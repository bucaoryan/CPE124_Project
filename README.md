Description:
The contactless alcohol dispenser promotes a simple and easy-to-use machine that provides cleanliness and sanitation for public communities. The system is designed to dispense alcohol automatically whenever it detects a user. The system will be using an IR sensor to detect if there is a motion for the system to react to. It will use a pump and relay module to release the alcohol contents. The data acquired by the system will then be directed to its web application in real-time monitoring the amount of alcohol left in the system and the number of people that have used the system. It also includes logs of the date and time the system activated. The components that will be used are the IR sensor, Raspberry PI, pump, and relay module.
