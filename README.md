## Description:
The Contactless Alcohol Dispenser system will use an IR sensor to detect if there is a motion for the system to react to. It will use a pump and relay module to release the alcohol contents inside the dispenser. The data acquired by the system is in a CSV file; this includes the log history and the activity updates on the page. It will then be directed to its web application in real-time, monitoring the amount of alcohol left in the system and the number of people using it. In addition, the monitoring will be seen on the page, such as the status of the alcohol dispenser, the total count of people who used the alcohol dispenser, and the date and time. The components will be the IR sensor, Raspberry PI, pump, and relay module.
